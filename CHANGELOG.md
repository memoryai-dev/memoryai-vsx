# Changelog

## 0.1.8

- Status bar now shows the full picture by default: total memories ·
  stores↑ recalls↓ this month · $ saved today. Every number is a real
  measurement from `/v1/stats` — no faked progress.
- New display modes: `full` (default), `tokens` repurposed as brain volume,
  `compact` repurposed as monthly activity. `savings` and `off` unchanged.

## 0.1.7

- New tagline: "One brain. Every AI you use. Forever." Description now leads
  with the multi-IDE shared-memory positioning.

## 0.1.6

- Repository moved to `github.com/memoryai-dev/memoryai-vsx` as the canonical
  source. No behaviour changes.

## 0.1.1

- The extension now wires every host file end-to-end on Connect: MCP config,
  Kiro Agent Hooks (auto-recall + auto-capture), Cursor rules, Windsurf rules.
  Memory becomes active from the next message with no manual config.
- Disconnect cleanly removes only the entries we created. Foreign content is
  always preserved.
- Wiring re-runs on every IDE start so config drift heals itself.
